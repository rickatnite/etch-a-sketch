# etch-a-sketch
The Odin Project: Etch-A-Sketch

Project Requirements:
1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
2. Create the divs using JavaScript, not HTML.
3. Use Flexbox (not CSS Grid) to make the divs appear as a grid.
4. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
5. Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
6. Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.
